Hello,

I am a driven teacher-turned-developer that is looking to integrate what I love about both professions into what I do every day.

I have loved every moment of teaching. Herndon High School was home and I look back with love. From the first year, with students only 2 years younger than me, to the JV basketball squad meetings after school, then the English Language Learner technology classes where I learned so much. Herndon taught me how to be a professional. To take pride in what I bring to the world. We were lucky to have each other.

Lately, between the schooldays, I have been brushing up on what I learned in college to push myself into development. The challenges have been different, but exhilarating. I am looking forward to pouring myself into this new career. While I am in transition, any support or connections to help me find my next home would go a long way.

With love,
Ben
